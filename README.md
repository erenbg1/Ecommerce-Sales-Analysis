# Ecommerce Sales Analysis

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes e-commerce sales transaction data to uncover key revenue trends, customer spending behavior, and market differences.  
Using data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical tests, the project provides business insights that help optimize marketing, inventory, and sales strategies.

## **Dataset**
- The dataset contains online retail transactions from multiple countries.
- Due to size limitations, the dataset can be downloaded from: **[Dataset Link]** (if applicable).

---

## **Key Findings**
- **Seasonal Revenue Trends:** Sales peak in certain months, indicating seasonal demand fluctuations.
- **Best-Selling Products:** A small group of products contributes to the majority of revenue, aligning with the 80/20 principle.
- **Market-Specific Differences:** Revenue distribution varies significantly across countries, requiring region-specific pricing and marketing strategies.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Most transactions are low-value, but a small segment of high-spending customers drives the majority of revenue.
- **Statistical Analysis:** The Kruskal-Wallis test confirms that revenue distribution differs significantly across countries, supporting the need for market-specific business strategies.
